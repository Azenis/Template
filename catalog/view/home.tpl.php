<?php echo $template->message(); ?>
<br>
Welcome and thank you for considering my template system :)<br>
If you are first time user it's recommended that you read this documentation first<br>
<br>
Having all this stuff in one place makes it very easy for one to get a head start and code without having to worry about every little detail.<br />
It will take time to use the system, and it will cause you a headache or two, but when you learn to use one and know how to code OOP, life's going to be much easier for you.<br />
<br />
<em>I'd recommend once you learned to code in this template, go ahead onto a real framework like code igniter, which have way more documentation than mine will ever get.</em>
