Allan Rehhoff PHP Template System
===
Just upload the files to your server and you're ready to go :)

See a working example at http://dev.rehhoff.me/template/index.php

Download: git clone https://github.com/Azenis/Template.git


Having all this code in place makes it much easier for one to get a head start and code without having to worry about every little detail.
Usefull for when developing internal systems or something from scratch where designer and developer needs to be able to cooperate.

It will take time to use the system, and it will cause you a headache or two, but when you learn to use one and know how to code OOP, life's going to be much easier for you.
